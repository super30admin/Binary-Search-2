# Time Complexity : O(lgN)
# Space Complexity : O(1).. didn't use extra space
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No. Just had to figure out 
# the logic (rotated array type question) which was discussed in previous class. Took awhile but I got it

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

        an array sorted in ascending order... Not duplicates
        Spitballing initial thoughts before starting: 
            - brute force is O(N) iterate through the nums array one and find the min value.. (linear search)
            - Can use binarySearch for O(logN) time.. 
        since its rotated.. we can use the trick to search in the sorted array
        In rotated... the min element is the min if the element before it is greater. 
        Can keep going until two values left..?
