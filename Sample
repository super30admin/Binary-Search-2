Problem Statement : Find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
Time Complexity : O(log n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : no

Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only :
First we do Binary search to find the starting index, ranging from first and last elem of the array,
then we perform binary search to find the last index, ranging from first index to last elem of the array.

Problem Statement : Find the minimum element in Rotated Sorted Array
Time Complexity : O(log n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : Nope

Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only :
We perform binary search on array until mid is smaller than its neighbors

Problem Statement : Find a peak element in random array
Time Complexity : O(log n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : no

Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only :
We perform binary search on full array if the mid is greater than its neighbors we return the mid index,
or we keep on with our search where the neighbor is greater than mid and keep moving in that direction until we find
mid is greater than its neighbors.
