'''Used binary search to find the side that definitely has a value higher than both
the mid and the edge. Because the edges are defined as next to a lower value by
definition, the side that definitely has a higher value is one where the mid
is lower than the edge. Or, if mid is higher than both edges, pick the side that has a 
higher value next to the mid.
