        Given problem conditions: 
            nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
            nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

        Using Binary Search, go to the direction where there is 
        higher valued element. Any sequence of an array is guaranteed to have
        1 peek due to above conditions.
