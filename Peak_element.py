'''This Python code defines a class Solution with a method findPeakElement, which performs binary search to find a peak element in a given list of integers.

The binary search is applied to efficiently locate a peak element, which is an element greater than its adjacent neighbors.

The code returns the index of the peak element when found; otherwise, it returns -1 if the input list is empty.
