         - the condition is nums[i] â‰  nums[i+1] *****
        e g. [ 4 5 6 7 0 1 2] two peaks at 7 and 2
        basically the logic is to give last element in a continuous increasing order
        for bin search we must have ascending order
        Case 1 : so if right side is not greater than mid, we [ 4 5 0 1] , 0 is not greater than 5, then search for peak on left
        Case 2 : so if right side is greater than mid, we [ 4 5 6 7 0 1] , 7 is greater than 6, then possible more higher values on right

        try with these cases :
        [1,2,1,3,2,1,0] , ideally two peaks, logic gives ans 2, index 1
        [1,2,1,3,2,1] , ideally two peaks, logic gives ans 3, index 3
