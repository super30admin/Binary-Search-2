'''
Applying BS:
1. Find mid
2. check if it is greater than all of its neighbours
    3. If yes, return mid
    else: move on the side of mid where the neighbouring element is greater.
    If both neighbours are greater, move to either side

Time Complexity : O(logN)
N: when finding the window
M: no. of elements in the window. (The one to which we apply Binary Search)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : Did not considered boundary conditions
in the second if condition.(elif part)
