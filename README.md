# Binary-Search-2

## Problem 1: (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

// Time complexity : O(logN)
// Space complexity : O(1) 

class Solution {
    // returns leftmost (or rightmost) index at which `target` should be
    // inserted in sorted array `nums` via binary search.
    private int extremeInsertionIndex(int[] nums, int target, boolean left) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length;

        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > target || (left && target == nums[mid])) {
                hi = mid;
            }
            else {
                lo = mid+1;
            }
        }

        return lo;
    }

    public int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] targetRange = {-1, -1};

        int leftIdx = extremeInsertionIndex(nums, target, true);

        // assert that `leftIdx` is within the array bounds and that `target`
        // is actually in `nums`.
        if (leftIdx == nums.length || nums[leftIdx] != target) {
            return targetRange;
        }

        targetRange[0] = leftIdx;
        targetRange[1] = extremeInsertionIndex(nums, target, false)-1;

        return targetRange;
    }
}

## Problem 2: (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

// Time complexity : O(logN)
// Space complexity : O(1) 

class Solution {
  public int findMin(int[] nums) {
    // If the list has just one element then return that element.
    if (nums.length == 1) {
      return nums[0];
    }

    // initializing left and right pointers.
    int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

    // if the last element is greater than the first element then there is no rotation.
    // e.g. 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 7. Already sorted array.
    // Hence the smallest element is first element. A[0]
    if (nums[right] > nums[0]) {
      return nums[0];
    }
    
    // Binary search way
    while (right >= left) {
      // Find the mid element
      int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

      // if the mid element is greater than its next element then mid+1 element is the smallest
      // This point would be the point of change. From higher to lower value.
      if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
        return nums[mid + 1];
      }

      // if the mid element is lesser than its previous element then mid element is the smallest
      if (nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]) {
        return nums[mid];
      }

      // if the mid elements value is greater than the 0th element this means
      // the least value is still somewhere to the right as we are still dealing with elements
      // greater than nums[0]
      if (nums[mid] > nums[0]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        // if nums[0] is greater than the mid value then this means the smallest value is somewhere to
        // the left
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
}

## Problem 3: (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5 
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 

             or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
Note:

Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

// Time complexity : O(logN)  We reduce the search space in half at every step
// Space complexity : O(1) 

public class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = (l + r) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1])
                r = mid;
            else
                l = mid + 1;
        }
        return l;
    }
}
