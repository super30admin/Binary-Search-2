## Problem 1: [FInd First and Last in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

- Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

- Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

- If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

  - Example 1:

    Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
    Output: [3,4]
    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
    Output: [-1,-1]

## Problem 2: [Min in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

- Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

- (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

- Find the minimum element.

- You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

  - Example 1:
    Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
    Output: 1

  - Example 2:
  Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
  Output: 0

## Problem 3: [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)
- A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

- Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

- The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

- You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

  - Example 1:

      Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
      Output: 2
      Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
      Example 2:

      Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
      Output: 1 or 5 
      Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
      Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
