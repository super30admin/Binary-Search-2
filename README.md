# Binary-Search-2

## Problem 1: (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

****
Approach:
1. Perform binarySearch on the lhs and rhs seperately
2. When performing binarySearch on lhs:
    2.1. If mid == Target; adjust high = mid -1 and call binarySearch function
    2.2. Return indexLeft if its not -1
    2.3. Else return mid
3. When performing binarySearch on rhs:
    2.1. If mid == Target; adjust low = mid +1 and call binarySearch function
    2.1. Return indexRight if its not -1
    2.2. Else return mid

Time Complexity 
2 * 0(logn) 

Since we ignore constants it's 0(logn)

## Problem 2: (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

**********
Approach:

1. Decide a pivot/target; generally we select last element.
2. If target<A[mid]
	2.1. perform recursive binarySearch on the LHS
	2.2. If a MATCH, return the index position
	2.3. If not a MATCH, -1 will be returned
	2.4. If -1 is returned, now perform recursive binarySearch on the RHS
3. If target>A[mid]
	3.1. Our target here is greater than the mid
	3.2. Update the target to A[mid]
	3.3. Once done; update the high == mid and do a recursive binary search
4. We will return index if out target == A[mid]

## Problem 3: (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5 
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 

             or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
Note:

Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

****
Approach: 
1. Find the mid
2. If arr[mid] > arr[mid-1] and arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]; return the mid
3. Else perform binarySearch on lhs if arr[mid]<arr[mid-1]
4. Or perform binarySearch on rhs if arr[mid]<arr[mid+1]
5. Take care for border case i.e. we have [0] i.e. 1 element only

Time Complexity 0(logn)
