######### Find minimum in rotated sorted array ###########

# Time Complexity :  O(logn)

# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No


# Keep checking the mid element with the last element if the mid element is smaller than the last pivot is to the left of mid
# and if the mid element is bigger than the last element then the pivot is on the right of the mid element. This pivot is
# also our min value in a rotated sorted array.

def find_pivot(nums):
  l = 0
  r = len(nums)-1
  while l<= r:
    mid = (l+r)//2
    if nums[mid] > nums[-1]:
      l = mid + 1
    else:
      r = mid - 1
  return nums[l]
