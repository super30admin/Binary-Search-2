// Time Complexity - O(logN)
// Space Complexity - O(logN)
// Worked on leetcode successfully : Yes

// we use binary search to solve this problem.
// the idea is to compare the middle element with the last element
// and continue to search in the rotated part as the minimum element will always be in the rotated part.
