"""
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [20,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: [20,19, 18, 17, 16, 10, 1, 2]
Output: 0

ez on search
bi search?
compare mid nt to last, which is smaller?
    back mid -1 //check if smaaler val exist
compare mid to first, smaller
middle value, no target
