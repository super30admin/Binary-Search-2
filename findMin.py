#Time Complexity=O(log n)
#Space Complexity=O(1)
# Diffciulties faced: I am using min() here , does that affect the time complexity?

# This algorithm is same as search.py submitted in Binary search -1  but instead of teh target I am replacing the target by min(nums) and instead of returning mid index, I am  returning the element present at that index

#1. Set low and high index of the array as 0 and length of array -1.
#2. Calcualte mid index.
#3. if the mid value is equal to min(nums), check if the its preceding value is equal to min(nums) or not so that we can confine our search space towards left and also check if mid is the 0th element (for the case where min(nums) is present at 0th index).
# If yes, then we return the mid, else we check if the min(nums) id greater or lesser then min(nums) and confine our search space as such by moving our low and high pointers.
# 4 Otherwise, we return -1 , ie if min(nums) is not found.
#5. Same procedure is followed for looking for last index.
