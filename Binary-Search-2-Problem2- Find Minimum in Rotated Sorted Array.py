Problem 2
153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Time Complexity : O( log n)
 

Space Complexity : O(1)
Constant Space 

Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes

BinarySearch is used to fing the minimum in the array
The condition used here is to if( arr[mid] > arr[r]):
    if the mid element value is greater than the last element pointed by the R 
    then the right side arry is considered by l=mid+1
    or else the the end points to the mid value
