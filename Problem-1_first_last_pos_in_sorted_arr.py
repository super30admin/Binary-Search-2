# Time Complexity : O(lg n) - first, last, searchRange
# Space Complexity : O(1)
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : Tried tocombine two searches in one BS. (Attempted before class)
#
# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# 1. Run two binary search for first and last occurrence of target separately
# 2. In first(), if mid finds target -> check if its greater than it's left neighbor (as it's sorted array) -> if Yes, return mid which is the first occurrence
                                      -> if Not, then we move to left as the first occurrence of target can only occur before this mid
# 3. Similarly in second(), if mid finds target -> check if its less than it's right neighbor (as it's sorted array) -> if Yes, return mid which is the last occurrence
                                      -> if Not, then we move to right as the last occurrence of target can only occur after this mid
