**Find the first and last position of element in sorted array**
Time Complexity: O(logN)
Space Complexity: O(1)


Obivously the ans is binary search,

but we will apply binary search seperately to determine the first and last index.

there may be duplicates avaliable in this case:
{5,7,7,8,8,8,8,10}

**1) Binary Search for first index**
	1. if mid == target -> check if the nums[mid-1] < nums[mid] || if its the 0th element
		if yes this is the first index else
		duplicates are present and need to move to left till we reach to the first index of target
	2. if not check the base condition and move low and high until we find our target
	
**2) Binary serach for last index**
	1. if mid == target -> check if the nums[mid+1] > nums[mid] || if its the last element
		if yes this is the last index else
		duplicates are present and need to move to right till we reach to the last index of target
	2. if not check the base condition and move low and high until we find our target







Find minimum in a rotated sorted array

Time complexity: O(logn)
Space Complexity: O(1)

1. if there is only element return it
2. if nums[mid -1] > nums[mid] then return nums[mid]
3. if nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] then return nums[mid-1] 
4. min is always present in an unsorted array
	if nums[low] < nums[mid] --> left side is sorted
		low = mid +1		//move to right side
	else 
		high = mid -1;
